# Killing Floor 2 Linux Server

This is (was) a setup of code running on a (free-tier) EC2 AWS instance, to setup and manage a Killing Floor 2 server.

One of the biggest issues I (and some of my friends) have had with playing KF2 has been finding the *perfect* server to play on. Using the server browser to find a map that meets *all* of the criteria you wanted was a chore at best and an impossibility at worst. Basically, out of the following categories, pick only two or three - as we probably won't find a server that matches more:

- Map + mode (and to make matters more complicated: custom maps)
- Player count
- Difficulty setting
- Map length (short, medium, long)
- Server location, connection, and ping for all the people that want to play
- Friends-only, no random joiners (depending on what we want at the time)

The solution seemed to be as simple as running our own server. :)

I initially ran this on an EC2 instance, but you could run this locally or in any of your preferred cloud computing solutions - whatever you want.

(NOTE: For EC2, you might have to, unfortunately, either go above a free-tier to get an instance with enough drive space to download/install KF2, or open an extra volume and attach it to your free-tiered EC2.)
