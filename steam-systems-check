# NOTE: This was mainly only useful for my specific AWS EC2 instance setup; with a mounted volume in a specified directory hooked up via symlink to an expected location for Steam installations.
# This is an optional runtime check used in the server startup to notify if anything is not properly configured or unexpected, and how & where it happens to be the case.

#====================================
# Usage:
#   bash ~/steam-systems-check
#
# Notes:
# - Exit code of `1` if any system check fails.
# - Exit code of `0` if all is well.
# - Error message should show appropriate measures to fix.
# - Use this script before any server start command for Steam games
#   (e.g.: Check the ~/kf2/start-server script)
#
# Reference:
# - YouTube video that shows some steps that are taken for setup:

#====================================

# VARIABLES
#====================================
# this would be different if the volume device name is different in EC2 config
VOLUME_NAME="${VOLUME_NAME:-xvdf}"
# this can be wherever you want, but I like using a root /mnt/ directory
MOUNT_DIR="${MOUNT_DIR:-/mnt/Games}"

# CONDITIONS
#====================================
# Does the expected device exist?
device_exists=$(lsblk | grep $VOLUME_NAME)
# Is the expected device a formatted volume? (let's expect XFS volume)
volume_formatted=$(file -s /dev/$VOLUME_NAME | grep 'XFS filesystem')

# SYSTEMS CHECK
#====================================
# sudo ./steam-systems-check seems to be inconsistent?
